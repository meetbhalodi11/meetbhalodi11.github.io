Remember you are riding a bike. So whenever you are on the road, don’t stuck behind cars. Find a way to move forward you will always find it surprising that there is a way! Just being stuck doesn’t get you anywhere. It’s the magic I want to see everyday. It might surprise you that many riders will stuck behind cars while you find your way and when you look back, no one is following you. Isn’t it surprising, to be at the place where no-one is following you? It’s a path less taken.
