Right now I am sitting on Indigo flight going from Ahmedabad to Pune. It’s the connecting flight came from Delhi. I went there for ng India conference. So anyway let’s skip to the part what I actually want to talk about. So the story is that while returning from conference to airport, Karan a friend I met few months ago came with us. Actually I invited him with us because he was also booking anther cab for himself. He was obviously spending more than use because he was alone. Anyway I invited him and took his terminal on priority as his flight was leaving early. He paid the whole amount of cab as we dropped off earlier and there was so much time for him to go to the terminal for his flight. I divided the total into three and paid the 2/3 of the amount immediately after he reached the airport. He insisted to divide it into half but I want to think that it’s not about the money, “it’s about the impression that you leave”. Believe me it’s after all it is about. How you made them feel is everything. It sets your standards. It presents your values. And believe me one day it will return to you compounding everything you did for them.
