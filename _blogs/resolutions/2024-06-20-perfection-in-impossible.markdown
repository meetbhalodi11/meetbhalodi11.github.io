Here is the speech from Roger F. given on a convocation of one college. The words are so relatable and touching. And it feels like we were focusion on the wrong thing all this time!

Thanks Roger! for proving us wrong

Here is goes

Perfection is impossible and 1526 singles matches that I have played in my career, I won almost 80% of those matches. Now I have a question for you--What percentage of points do you think I won in those matches?--Only 54%. In other words, even top ranked tennis players berely win more than half of the points they play. When you lose evey second point on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot. You teach yourself to think--okay! I double faulted, it's only a point, I came to netand got passed again, it's only a point. Even a great shot and overhead back head smash that ends up in ESPN's top 10 play shot, that o is just a point and here is why I am telling you this, Is because when you are playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world and it is, but when it's behind you, it's behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point and next point and the next one after that, with intensity, clarity and focus.
