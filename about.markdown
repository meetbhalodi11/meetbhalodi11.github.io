Hello all, Meet here is this side. I know the theme looks bit 90's style but trust me the content will be awesome. Anyho, let me tell you about myself. I am a Software Developer and I love to write things. So here you will find all sorts of things, from Tech blogs to Philosophy to even photographly blogs. I know, I know you must think that this guy has no niche, but hey who know this will help me find my niche. Okay then I will see you around!
