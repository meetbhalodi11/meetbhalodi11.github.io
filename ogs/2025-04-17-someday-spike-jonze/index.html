<meta name="description" content="This video was suggested by BK few days ago when we were in office, The starting might feel like bit off but as you go along it slowlyy grows on you. I started loving this song. And it is still going on loop whenever I am in office and feel like listening to music. And last week I spend almost 2-3 hours in Airport listening to this song. I feel I will never get tired of this song. And the most exciting part is when song stars and that word “Agoda agoda, vai” it hits like a trigger–almost a push of productivity." />
